# Analysis Core

> Internal shared skill. Single source of truth for **analysis-stage methodology** used by PDCA fix workflows. Workflows keep their own orchestration (exits, manual/auto mode, OpenSpec/Jira artifact sinks, intentional divergences).
>
> **Prerequisite check**: this skill declares strong dependencies in frontmatter. On load, verify each is available; if any is missing, abort and print the install command (`npx skills add FuDesign2008/open-skills -g --skill '*' --yes`). No silent fallback.

## Placeholder contracts

This skill is shared by workflows with different stage numbering. Never hardcode a workflow's stage numbers or titles here.

| Placeholder | Meaning | Who maps it |
|-------------|---------|-------------|
| `{next-stage}` | Stage to enter after analysis exit gate / after instrumentation resolves | Referencing workflow, at the reference line (number + name) |
| `{root-cause step}` / `{impact-assessment step}` / `{upstream-eval step}` | Step numbers inside the analysis stage for `known-issue-research` | Same reference line (existing known-issue-research contract) |

## 1. Temporary-change permission and rollback gate

Analysis is read-only by default. Analysis-assist edits only are allowed; they must be registered and fully rolled back before entering `{next-stage}`. Fix implementation belongs in the workflow's execution stage — not here.

**Allowed (analysis-assist only):**
- Instrumentation, temporary logs, reproduction scripts
- Hypothesis-validation edits (e.g. flip a condition to observe behavior) — restore after validation

**Forbidden:** edits whose purpose is to implement the fix.

**Register (mandatory):** for every temporary edit, record immediately: file + location + original content + purpose (rollback basis).

**Exit gate (must complete before `{next-stage}`):**
1. Restore originals one-by-one from the register (**register is authoritative**; `git diff` only helps confirm register items are clear — the worktree may already have user edits)
2. Output「临时改动清单 + 回滚验证」
3. If anything remains unrolled-back, do not enter `{next-stage}`; keeping an edit requires explicit user confirmation
4. Close the stage output with the §5 analysis gate output block (its temporary-changes line carries this list)

**Tool limits (analysis stage):** ✅ Read/Grep/SemanticSearch; ✅ WebSearch (research routing / quick search / upstream-eval / `runtime-evidence-debug` escape hatch); ✅ Edit/Write only for analysis-assist edits above; ✅ Bash for read-only verification commands — running the app under debug or reproduction steps still needs user confirmation (see §3).

## 2. Analysis step skeleton

1. **Existence check** (gate — always first)
   - Locate relevant code with Read/Grep/SemanticSearch
   - Act on the verdict:

   | Verdict | Action |
   |---------|--------|
   | ✅ Problem exists | Continue to step 2 → 3–8 |
   | ❌ Problem gone | Report it may already be fixed or logic changed, cite locations, **stop and wait for user** |
   | ⚠️ Description mismatches code | Report the mismatch, **return to the workflow's problem-clarification stage** |

2. **Research routing** — load `known-issue-research` and follow it (triage + known-issue quick search + industry-wide evaluation). The referencing workflow's reference line supplies `{root-cause step}` / `{impact-assessment step}` / `{upstream-eval step}` maps. Report templates: `known-issue-research/reference.md`.

3. **Phenomenon** — reproduction conditions/steps; when the issue is browser-reproducible, prefer `browser-debug-toolkit` to reproduce and observe runtime state (not limited to UI/CSS/DOM; follow that skill's degradation path if browser automation is unavailable).

4. **Locate** — file paths + line numbers, key functions/classes.

5. **Red-capable loop gate** (before multi-hypothesis root-cause guessing)
   - A **red-capable loop** = a deterministic, agent-runnable failing reproduction (command, test, or equivalent observed failure) that has **already been run at least once** in this analysis stage and observed red/failing.
   - A user-reported symptom (pasted log, verbal description, screenshot) does **not** count as an agent-observed red.
   - **If missing:** do **not** emit a speculative multi-hypothesis “likely root causes” list. First establish the loop (repro steps, instrumentation per §3). If no agent-runnable loop can be established, the escape MUST land as an explicit user handoff — instrumentation and reproduction steps handed to the user per `runtime-evidence-debug`'s human-AI division — or a stop with the gap stated; never a silent pass.
   - **If present:** proceed to step 6. The stage output closes with the §5 analysis gate output block (red-loop line included).

6. **Root cause** — data flow and call-chain analysis; falsifiable hypotheses only after step 5 is satisfied.

7. **Upstream dependency fix evaluation** (optional) — when root cause is an upstream dependency bug, or step 2 found an upstream fixed version: load `upstream-dependency-debug` and follow it. Outcomes: low-risk upgrade → recommend upgrade in solution exploration; risky → list upgrade alongside workarounds; unfixed → workaround marked temporary.

8. **Impact** — affected modules/features.

If existence fails or description mismatches, do not proceed to solution exploration.

### Analysis-stage red flags

- Research route is 🔵/🟣 but known-issue quick search is skipped; or 🟢 with quick-search triggers hit yet WebSearch is skipped for “read code first”
- Named third-party lib/framework in the root cause without checking upstream Changelog/Release Notes before piling workarounds
- Using “analysis” to ship a fix — temporary edits beyond hypothesis validation, or entering `{next-stage}` without rollback
- Temporary edits not registered, or missing「临时改动清单 + 回滚验证」before `{next-stage}`
- Emitting multi-hypothesis root-cause guesses **without** a red-capable loop (or an explicit, user-visible statement that no loop is possible)

## 3. Instrumentation debug (runtime observation — default entry)

**State-based triggers** (any one; prefer before entering `{next-stage}`):
- Static analysis stalled — module roughly known, concrete mechanism or path unconfirmable by reading code
- Retry/continue — a fix based on static analysis was applied and the problem remains
- Silent failure — call chain and logs look correct but behavior is wrong
- Fix verification needs before/after runtime evidence

**Default entry**: when any trigger fires, load `runtime-evidence-debug` first and follow its lifecycle (escalation decision → instrumentation design → reproduction → evidence tiers → confidence gating → escape hatch → fix verification). Entry is a state judgment ("runtime observation is needed"), not a self-assessed confidence verdict; the skill's own static-first escalation decision remains authoritative.

**Scenario composition** (on demand; each keeps its own authority):
- Browser-reproducible → instrumentation delegates tool selection to `browser-debug-toolkit`; if the phenomenon step already did browser repro, continue here only if static analysis still stalls
- Hybrid app (native shell + WebView/WKWebView/Electron + H5) → consult `hybrid-debug` for layer localization before instrumenting
- Real-device observation → compose channel enablers (e.g. `android-webview-debug` to establish the connection); `runtime-evidence-debug` decides what to observe, evidence tier, and when confidence suffices

Execution details, confidence gating, and escape hatches live in each skill's current SKILL.md — read before invoking.

**Tool limits:** ✅ Read/Grep to choose instrumentation sites; instrumentation and validation edits follow §1 (AI may add instrumentation and must register it); ❌ do not run reproduction steps without user confirmation.

## 4. Debug-verify loop (verification stage)

When the analysis stage used a debug skill to find the root cause, the workflow's verification stage MUST use the **same** skill to verify the fix (not tests alone):

- Browser-reproducible (`browser-debug-toolkit`) → same skill; before/after runtime state (DOM / computed style / box model / console / network); confirm the anomaly is gone
- Runtime evidence (`runtime-evidence-debug`) → re-check original instrumentation sites; before/after evidence; confirm abnormal behavior is gone
- Hybrid (`hybrid-debug`) → verify affected layers (L1–L4); no new cross-layer side effects

## 5. Analysis gate output block (mandatory stage-closing block)

Single source of truth for the block that MUST close every referencing workflow's analysis-stage output before entering `{next-stage}`. Workflows reference this block with a thin pointer; they never restate its fields.

```
【Analysis gate / 分析门控】
Red loop: ✅ <command + one-line red evidence observed this stage> / ❌ <why unestablished + handoff already proposed: instrumentation/repro steps handed to the user>
Debug entry: runtime-evidence-debug loaded (trigger: static stalled / retry / silent failure / before-after verification) / not needed (one-line Tier 1–2 evidence)
Scenario supplements: browser-debug-toolkit / hybrid-debug / channel enabler (e.g. android-webview-debug): engaged(<which>) / not needed
Temporary changes: none / <registered list + rollback verified>
```

Rules:

- A missing or unfilled block blocks entry to `{next-stage}` — filling it is the entry condition, and being unable to fill a line (e.g. red loop) is itself the escalation signal.
- "Not needed" fills are legal but require their one-line evidence; blank or evasive fills are not.
- Red-loop line follows §2 step 5 (user-pasted evidence does not satisfy it); debug-entry line follows §3 (state-based trigger).

## Integration guide (for referencing workflows)

- **Declare** `analysis-core` in frontmatter `dependencies`; abort at workflow startup if missing.
- **Thin reference shape (preferred):** one short「委托 `analysis-core`」block with `{next-stage}` + known-issue-research step maps (number + name only); do **not** restate §§1–3 prose or re-list the analysis step skeleton.
- **Keep in the workflow body:** orchestration only — exits/mode, OpenSpec/Jira sinks, intentional divergences (形似神异), difficulty/path tables.
- **Verify stage:** one line pointing at §4 — do not paste debug-verify bullets.
- **reference.md:** point to this skill for methodology; keep workflow-specific output templates; do not duplicate gate prose.
- **Do not** sink intentional divergences (coverage-gate strength, test-suite-ensure blocking, industry-eval Jira gate, etc.) into this skill.
